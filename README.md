# AlohaMini — Open-Source Dual-Arm AI Robot Kit  

**Affordable. Home-buildable. Fully hackable. Costs less than an iPhone.**

AlohaMini is an **open-source dual-arm mobile robot** for embodied AI, teleoperation, and robotics research.  

Inspired by **ALOHA**, **LeKiwi**, and **Pi-0.5**, it brings real dual-arm manipulation technology to **home labs, makers, and independent researchers** — not just corporations and university labs.

> **Build and control a real dual-arm robot — at home, for the price of a phone.**

Unlike many robots with closed APIs and restricted modification, **AlohaMini is fully open**:  
you can inspect, modify, re-print, and re-program everything. No vendor lock-in. No black boxes.

## 🧠 Why AlohaMini?

- **Real dual-arm robot (16 DOF)**
- **Can be built at home** with a consumer 3D printer
- **Cheaper than one iPhone**
- Works with **LeRobot** (teleop + imitation learning)
- Keyboard / voice teleop
- Replace any part — mechanical, firmware, software, AI model
- Designed for **learning, research, hacking, and creative robotics**

> A hardware tool for people who love to **build, modify, and understand** robots — not just watch them.

**AlohaMini flips the table**:

> 🔓 **You own it. You control it. You can change anything.**

Modify freely:

- CAD & structural parts  
- Motor logic & firmware  
- Teleoperation interface  
- AI training pipeline  
- OS, compute hardware, sensors  

**A robot engineered by makers, for makers.**

Standing on the shoulders of open robotics pioneers — **ALOHA / LeKiwi / Pi-0.5** — and pushing the idea further:

> **Lab-grade robotics → home-buildable, low-cost, fully open.**
